## A little explanation:

Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are implemented in the corresponding folders:

- [Task-1-Factory-method](src%2FTask-1-Factory-method)
- [Task-2-Abstract-factory](src%2FTask-2-Abstract-factory)
- [Task-3-Singleton](src%2FTask-3-Singleton)
- [Task-4-Prototype](src%2FTask-4-Prototype)
- [Task-5-Builder](src%2FTask-5-Builder)

UML diagrams for tasks 1, 2 and 5 are located in the same folders.

In the main method [main.ts](src%2Fmain.ts) the launch of each task is implemented through functions that are commented by default.
