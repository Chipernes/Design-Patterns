## A little explanation:

Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are implemented in the corresponding folders:

- [Task-1-Adapter](src%2FTask-1-Adapter)
- [Task-2-Decorator](src%2FTask-2-Decorator)
- [Task-3-Bringe](src%2FTask-3-Bringe)
- [Task-4-Proxy](src%2FTask-4-Proxy)
- [Task-5-Composer](src%2FTask-5-Composer)
- [Task-6-Lightweight](src%2FTask-6-Lightweight)


In the main method [main.ts](src%2Fmain.ts) the launch of each task is implemented through functions that are commented by default.
